# Face Your Fears 🎮
This is a 3D first-person wave-based castle defense game built in Unity. You play as a child who must fight off their nightmares using unlockable powers and abilities in order to escape their dream.

The project was a collaborative game development effort during college, and I focused heavily on player systems, effects, and gameplay feel.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This project was my first time developing a complete combat system in Unity from scratch, as part of a team. While the enemies and level design were handled by other members, I was fully in charge of everything that made the player feel responsive and powerful.

It taught me how to:
- Collaborate on Unity projects using Git and Trello
- Create clean, modular systems for combat and abilities
- Connect UI, animation, SFX, and game logic for tight gameplay feedback
- Balance a game’s progression and difficulty around the player experience
